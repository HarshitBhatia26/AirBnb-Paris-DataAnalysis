# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis – Python Project  

## 🔎 Overview  
This project analyzes **Airbnb listings data** using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.)** to uncover insights into pricing, availability, and customer behavior.  
The goal is to understand **market dynamics** and identify trends that can help hosts, guests, and stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

- Listing ID & Name  
- Host details 👤  
- Neighborhood / Location 📍  
- Room type 🏠  
- Price 💰  
- Minimum nights 💤  
- Number of reviews ⭐  
- Availability (per year) 📅

## 🔧 Data Cleaning  
Steps performed before analysis:  
- ✅ Removed duplicate entries  
- ✅ Handled missing values  
- ✅ Converted data types (e.g., dates, numbers)  
- ✅ Filtered outliers (unrealistic prices & nights)  
- ✅ Standardized categorical fields for grouping
